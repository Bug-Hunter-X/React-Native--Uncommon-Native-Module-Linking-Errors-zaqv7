# React Native Uncommon Native Module Linking Errors

This repository demonstrates uncommon variations of native module linking errors in React Native and provides solutions.  Standard linking solutions often fail to address the nuances presented here.  The example utilizes a hypothetical native module for illustrative purposes.

## Bug Description:
The project uses a third-party library ('ReactNativeHypotheticalModule') with native modules. Linking appears successful via standard methods (e.g., `react-native link`), yet runtime errors indicate the native module is unavailable. This may stem from issues beyond simple missing links, like conflicting dependencies or environment inconsistencies.

## Reproduction Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run the app. You should observe a runtime error indicating that the native module is not found or an undefined method is called.

## Solution:
The solution explores less-common approaches needed to resolve these obscure linking errors: manual linking, dependency investigation, and environment checks. These can include verifying correct project configurations, cleaning build artifacts, and ensuring consistent environments across development and build machines. For the hypothetical scenario, an approach of manual linking and rigorous dependency analysis is shown.

## Additional Notes:
This example highlights challenges in debugging native module issues.  Thorough error logging and debugging within native code is often necessary.  This repository intends to serve as a guide for tackling those difficult-to-solve native module integration issues, beyond the typical troubleshooting steps.
